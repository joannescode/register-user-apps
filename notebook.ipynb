Your managers have asked you to develop a new account registration system for a mobile app. The system must validate user input on the sign-up form before creating an account. \n","\n","The previous junior developer wrote some helper functions that validate the name, email, and password. Use these functions to register users, store their data, and implement some error handling! These have been imported into the workspace for you. They will be a great help to you when registering the user, but first you have to understand what the function does! Inspect the docstrings of each of the helper functions: `validate_name`, `validate_email` and `validate_password`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"89e2bca9-7ff6-4259-b33a-a85607997083","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":160,"lastExecutedAt":1709311428512,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell and examine the docstring of each function\nfrom python_functions import validate_name, validate_email, validate_password, top_level_domains\n\nprint(\"validate_name\\n\")\nprint(validate_name.__doc__)\nprint(\"--------------------\\n\")\n\nprint(\"validate_email\\n\")\nprint(validate_email.__doc__) \nprint(\"--------------------\\n\")\n\nprint(\"validate_password\\n\")\nprint(validate_password.__doc__)\n\n# The top level domains variable is used in validate_email to approve only certain email domains\nprint(top_level_domains)","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":616,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Re-run this cell and examine the docstring of each function\n","from python_functions import (\n","    validate_name,\n","    validate_email,\n","    validate_password,\n","    top_level_domains,\n",")\n","\n","print(\"validate_name\\n\")\n","print(validate_name.__doc__)\n","print(\"--------------------\\n\")\n","\n","print(\"validate_email\\n\")\n","print(validate_email.__doc__)\n","print(\"--------------------\\n\")\n","\n","print(\"validate_password\\n\")\n","print(validate_password.__doc__)\n","\n","# The top level domains variable is used in validate_email to approve only certain email domains\n","print(top_level_domains)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"af95fd36","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"05f8c17e-84b8-420c-84f1-af7015efbc8e","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":48,"lastExecutedAt":1709311428560,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Start coding here\n# Use as many cells as you need"},"outputs":[],"source":["def validate_user(name, email, password):\n","    \"\"\"Validates the user's name, email, and password.\n","\n","    This fucton calls validate_name, validate_email, and validade_password from python_fuctions.py to check if the provided credentials are valid.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        name (str): The user's name.\n","        email (str): The user's email.\n","        password (str): The user's password.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        bool: True if all validations pass, otherwise False.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if (\n","        validate_name(name)\n","        and validate_email(email)\n","        and validate_password(password)\n","    ):\n","        return True\n","    else:\n","        raise ValueError(\"One or more validations did not pass\")\n","\n","def register_user(name, email, password):\n","    \"\"\"Register User in case the user's name, email, and password pass.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        name (str): The user's name.\n","        email (str): The user's email.\n","        password (str): The user's password.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        dict: In case all validations pass, return a dict from user_registred with credentials, otherwise False.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if validate_user(name, email, password):\n","        user_registred = {\"name\": name, \"email\": email, \"password\": password}\n","        return user_registred\n","    else:\n","        return False\n","    \n","register_user(name=\"Lucas\", email=\"datacamp_student@gmail.com\", password=\"Datacamp#15\")"]}],"metadata":{"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
